### Hey it works for me, OK? for a few days been working on this proj. I am very happy with the result (i feel confidentier to code with python, and django now, it works, for me). too bad i cant showcase others the end-result, every query would cost me some $ with rapidapi. maybe one day i will find a costless api, db to connect to...

`run pip install -r requirements.txt`

create ur .env in base dir fill in your rapidapikey it will cost a little$$ for each query 
`RAPIDAPI_KEY=`

- create, connect db and modify settings.py for postgresql db [zeet](https://zeet.co)  [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/de/)
